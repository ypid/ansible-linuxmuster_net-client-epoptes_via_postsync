  synopsis: |
    This role is intended to run against a [linuxmuster.net](https://linuxmuster.net) client and configure [epoptes](http://www.epoptes.org/).
    It is based on [the documentation at linuxmuster.net](http://www.linuxmuster.net/wiki/anwenderwiki:linuxclient:epoptes).

    The features are:

    * Install the client and server (master) component of epoptes.
    * Delete some configuration files to allow the usage of the client as system master system (teacher) and as client system (student).

    The decision which role a system will play is configured via the [Postsync feature](http://www.linuxmuster.net/wiki/anwenderwiki:linbo:postsync_scripte:start) of [LINBO](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINBO).
    There is another role which configures this on the server-side. See [`ypid.linuxmuster_net-client-epoptes_via_postsync`](https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles/4113).
